I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree at Sichuan University in 2021. My research interests lie in imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and their applications in robotics. Since October 2024, I have been a visiting scholar in [Prof. Lin Shao](https://linsats.github.io/)'s Lab at the National University of Singapore.
